# Swift-Colab Development Repository

This is a repository for designing the new [Swift-Colab](https://github.com/philipturner/swift-colab). It will be rebuilt from the group up to rely less on Python libraries, eliminate all Python code from the GitHub repository, and improve launch speed. It will also be compatible with Docker, making it a complete successor to [google/swift-jupyter](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter).
